### To brake the ice


To be honest I don't really like speak to much about myself. I can say that I have a lot of experience in non-IT districts.
And my experience says that in any business or team-work people matter. Matter a lot. And I can listen and conversate with **emphathy**. 
So don't hesitate contact me. 

### Let's get down to business

**So my strengnesses are** :
* continiously self-educating person
* soft-skilled
* extremly motivated ( well, you've seen the picture above )
 
**Anyway for now I have some basic following skills**:
* HTML
    * a bit semantic
* CSS
    * a bit styling
* JavaScript
    * some types, functions, methods etc. U+1F643
* Typescript
    * some basic stuf

 *The function below as the example of my JS, reverses the long words in a string* 
 
 ```
 function spinWords(string){
    const result = string
                      .split(' ')
                      .map(it => it.length > 5 
                      ? it.split('').reverse().join('') 
                      : it)
                      .join(' ')
            return result
   }
```
***Courses/education***
